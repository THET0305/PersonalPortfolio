    <!-- Project Overview -->
    <h2>Komatsu UGSR Battery Hauler Operator Training Simulator</h2>
    <p>
        In response to the need for **remote training in India during the pandemic**, I initiated the development of a VR training simulator as a rapid prototype. 
        Using a gaming joystick, pedals, and a VR headset, I created a proof of concept to demonstrate how operators could learn to drive the Komatsu Battery-powered Hauler in an underground mining environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        After securing executive buy-in, I expanded the prototype into an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to gauge customer interest. Once demand was confirmed, I worked with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A third-party development team to create a hardware interface allowing real machine controls to be used in my software.</li>
        <li>Internal mechanical engineers to design a mobile simulator frame integrating the real seat and interface devices.</li>
        <li>Marketing and branding teams to establish a recognizable product identity.</li>
    </ul>
