Dear [Hiring Managerâ€™s Name or Hiring Team],

Iâ€™m excited to apply for the [Position Title] at [Company Name]. With 10+ years of Unity development experience, I specialize in creating immersive simulations, VR training tools, and multi-platform applications for PC, VR, Android, and WebGL. My background is non-traditionalâ€”I started self-taught, developing Joy Mining Machineryâ€™s first in-house operator training simulator, and have since grown into a senior developer leading simulation and interactive training projects at Komatsu Mining Corp.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked across VR hardware (Oculus Rift, Quest 2/3, HTC Vive Pro, HP Reverb G2, PICO 4), integrated real-time multiplayer systems (Netcode for GameObjects), and optimized complex simulators using DOTS/ECS. I also explore emerging technologies like Generative AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Unity Muse, Meta AI) to accelerate workflows, assist in asset generation, and prototype new ideas faster.

Beyond my professional work, Iâ€™ve created personal projects such as:  
- ASIC Workbench Demo (WebGL) â€“ An interactive proof-of-concept for technical training on ASIC cryptocurrency miners.  
- Quest Board REST â€“ A Unity project integrating with a mock REST API backend for quest tracking.  

What excites me about [Company Name] is [specific reason about the company/product/mission]. I thrive in environments where I can rapidly prototype, collaborate across disciplines, and push the boundaries of interactive experiences.

Iâ€™d love the opportunity to bring my Unity expertise, VR/AR development skills, and passion for innovation to [Company Name]. Iâ€™m happy to share personal projects as examples of my work, since most of my professional projects are proprietary.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team and help [Company Name] achieve its goals.

Best regards,  
Timothy J. Snyder
